          <p><A HREF="/">Truckerswelcome.ca</A> is an open source project developed by volunteers in the tech community
            to help our front line workers who are facing significant challenges while on the road keeping goods and
            supplies flowing to our grocery stores, hospitals and communities. Truckers Welcome helps drivers find
            services that are still available near them during this crisis, using the location on their smartphone. This
            project is made possible by our generous sponsors and volunteers.

            This project is hosted in the Google Cloud Platform, relies on the Google Maps API and uses DNS and Email
            services provided by EasyDNS. The cost for these resources are currently covered by our volunteers, we are
            currently looking for corporate sponsors to help with resources or funding to keep this project alive during
            the pandemic.
