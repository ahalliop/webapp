	  <H3>How to Help</H3>
	  <p><A HREF="/">Truckerswelcome.ca</A> is an open source initiative to help our truck, delivery and transit drivers who are putting themselves at risk to keep our supply chain moving during the COVID-19 pandemic and finding it increasingly difficult to get access to the basic services they need due to social distancing measures.</P>
	  
	  <p>For more information on the challenges they are facing see <A HREF="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/rest-stops-barring-washroom-access-to-truckers-a-huge-problem-as-virus-spreads-1.4874430">this recent CBC news article</A>.</P>

	  <H4>Developers</H4>
	  If you are a developer, here's a list of next steps to get this off the ground:
	  <UL>
		  <LI>Set up git repository for the project</LI>
		  <LI>Set up a slack group for the project</lI>
		  <LI>Set up the DevOps infrastructure so we can deliver stable functional increments</LI>
		  <LI>Implement the application database (list of businesses, their location and services they are offering to drivers)</LI>
		  <LI>Front-end development for the application interface (browser based but primarily usable on mobile devices)</LI>
		  <LI>Backend development to support location based searches and other server-side functions</LI>
		  <LI>Security leads to ensure security best practices are followed at the database, source code and operational level</LI>
	</UL>
	The github project is here: <A HREF="https://github.com/truckerswelcome/webapp">https://github.com/truckerswelcome/webapp</A><BR>
	Use this link to join the slack channel: <A HREF="https://join.slack.com/t/truckerswelcome/shared_invite/zt-dakd3cn7-ndNJDH0JyUBTy09ABT0A1Q">https://join.slack.com/t/truckerswelcome/shared_invite/zt-dakd3cn7-ndNJDH0JyUBTy09ABT0A1Q</A>

	<H4>Community</H4>
	This initiative will only succeed with support from the broader community. Here are a few things you can do to help:
	<UL>
		<LI>Spread the word. We need data for this to be useful to our drivers. The more businesses in the database, the more helpful this will be to drivers. It would be great to get help from the media to inform businesses and drivers once the minimum viable product is up and running.</LI>
		<LI>Gather & input data. Do you know of a business that is offering services to drivers? Send that information over or use the application interface (once it is operational) to enter the information.
		<LI>Help with resources. The application is running in Google Cloud and using the Google Maps API. If you have contacts within Google that can help with cloud resources please reach out to them.</LI>
	</UL>
